# dyanmic_i2c_adapter_search
dynamically finds/opens an i2c adapter in linux. Written in c++.

#Wrote a version of this at work in C. It was really ugly so I wrote a c++ version too. I couldn't find any examples online for this even #though the linux documentation recommends a dynamic search for the adapter.

#The logging could be cleaned up a bit. It is a good starting point to for some embedded i2c work in linux.
